    When I came to Barbara, I had just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Crohn’s disease. I was on 3 or 4 different medications, was severely depressed, had an over-eating issue and a problem with alcohol, and little to no self esteem. Basically, I was miserable, and didn’t know there was a way out.
    
    Within a year I was off all of my medications, which people are STILL amazed by, and my mood/outlook on life changed dramatically. I was no longer depressed, I was motivated and getting happier by the day, and I was on my way to help others do the same.
    
    Cut to today: I am a yoga teacher and spiritual mindset coach who helps others learn tools to shift their mindsets and live a happier and more peaceful life. I refer all of my clients to Barbara, and believe that homeopathy plays such a HUGE integral part in any healing process.
    
    If you work with Barbara, you will NOT regret it. She literally works miracles. WhatEVER the issue is, she can help you.`,

    Within days of taking my remedy I experienced a fundamental internal shift that encouraged my journey toward empowerment, true mental health and a renewed sense of spirituality and wholeness. 
    
    I highly recommend Barbara!`,

    Well, the results of my remedy were beyond what I had imagined. What I found was that instead of individual complaints being addressed, my overall being calmed down and stabilized.  That’s the best way I can describe it.  
    
    The stabilization impacted almost every part of my life, so the result was a systematic calming and reorienting of most of the problems I had been dealing with.  This has made the ups and downs of my frenetic daily routine become manageable and my life more even keeled.  It truly made a difference in my life.`,

    When Barbara mentioned to me the possibility of finding a homeopathic solution that could assist me with my struggle, I was excited and eager to learn what this was all about.  
    
    After a couple of very extensive consultations she presented a remedy that helped me to become “unstuck.”  I immediately noticed myself having more energy, I became more focused on my goals and each day noticed my whole mindset to be much more positive than it had been in quite some time. 
    
    To date I have lost 65 pounds.  I exercise 3 mornings a week, and best of all, I feel healthy.  I credit homeopathy for the new me that is slowly emerging.`,
