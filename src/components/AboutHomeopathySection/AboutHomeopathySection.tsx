          Homeopathy re-establishes and strengthens the body’s predisposition
          for health because it treats the body’s innate capacity to heal
          itself. Mental, emotional and physical are treated as one dynamic
          disturbance.
        </Styled.Paragraph>
        <Styled.Paragraph>
          It is a holistic modality that treats the person, not the disease as
          it is termed in medicine, so all conditions have a potential for
          resolution.
        </Styled.Paragraph>
        <Styled.Paragraph>
          It has been a safe and practical healing art for over 200 years.
          Homeopathy is 100 percent non-toxic, non-addictive and U.S. FDA
          approved. Many remedies are available over the counter from health
          food stores or are available from natural care pharmacies worldwide.
