          question="Can homeopathy help me with my current condition?"
          answer="Homeopathy stimulates your own innate ability to heal and 
          is usually not limited by the nature of the disease as itâ€™s termed 
          by the medical profession. Mental, emotional and physical issues are 
          treated as one dynamic disturbance, holistically."
        />
        <QuestionGroup
          question="What will my homeopathic consultation be like?"
          answer="Your homeopath will ask you about your personal history and what you
            would like to see healed. In order to understand you as a unique
            individual, you will be asked to share details about how you live in
            your world and experience life. There are no physical examinations."
        />
        <QuestionGroup
          question="How often and how long are the appointments?"
          answer="The first visit is usually between two to three hours long.
            Follow-up visits are usually an hour long. The first follow-up visit
            is normally 4 weeks after the initial consultation. Your individual
            needs will determine the frequency of the follow-up visits
            thereafter; normally, they are at 1 month intervals in the
            beginning. The goal is to get you healthy so you only call your
            homeopath as needed."
